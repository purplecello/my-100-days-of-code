## 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 16/12/23 

**Today's Progress**: Started [freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) certification course.

**Thoughts:** This is for very beginners, after the first two courses, I jumped to the certification projects and completed "Survey Form" and "Tribute Page"

### Day 1: 18/12/23 

**Today's Progress**: Completed [freecodecamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) third ("Technical Documentation", fourth ("Product Page") and final ("Personal Portfolio" certification project, and got my free "Responsive Web Design Certification"!

**Thoughts:** I am thinking whether to take reecodecamp's next course, "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures". I am worried the level will be directed to complete beginners, and will not be able to get motivated enough.

2.  Fork this repo and commit to the [Log](log.md) or to the Alternative, rapid [R1 Log](r1-log.md) (R1 stands for Round 1) daily. [Example](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-kallaway-log).
3.  **Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.**
4.  **Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day! Pay it forward!**
5.  Change the date in [Rules](rules.md) to the day you've started the challenge.
6.  Delete the examples in the log, or comment them out, and start filling it with your own content.
7.  **Tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.**
8.  Follow [Alex, creator of #100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/ka11away) & [100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode) Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. It's a great way to keep yourself motivated and to participate in the community. Thanks [@amanhimself](https://twitter.com/amanhimself) for creating it!
9.  Important: (see No.4 above for a specific rule on this) Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
10. If you find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo, or just tweet at me (see info below)
